# Graphical Simulations Repository

This repository contains a series of graphical simulation projects using Python's Tkinter and Turtle modules. These projects serve as foundational demonstrations, providing a basis for creating more complex and interactive graphical simulations.

## Projects

1. **Animation Demo**  
   A simple animation showcasing different shapes cycling through various patterns using the Turtle module.

2. **Bouncing Ball Simulator**  
   A dynamic simulation where multiple balls bounce around the screen, demonstrating basic physics principles like gravity and elasticity.

3. **Ping Pong Game**  
   A basic interactive ping pong game showcasing object movement and collision detection founded upon the priciples of the previous two projects.

## Getting Started

To run these simulations, you will need Python installed on your computer. Each folder in the repository contains the source code for one of the projects. Simply run the Python files to start the simulations.

## Contributing

Contributions to enhance these simulations or add new ones are welcome. Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests with your improvements or new simulation ideas.
